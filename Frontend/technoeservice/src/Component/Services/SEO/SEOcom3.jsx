      <h1>Essential Processes for SEO Success</h1>
      <p>
        SEO isn’t just about ranking on search engines — it’s about driving the right traffic to your website and providing value to your audience. To get results, you need a clear, well-structured process that connects your content, website performance, and audience intent.
      </p>
      <p>
        Understanding the key stages of SEO helps you improve visibility, attract organic traffic, and stay ahead of your competitors in the digital space.
      </p>
      <p>Here’s what an effective SEO strategy should include:</p>

      <div className="smp-feature">
        <FaClipboardList className="smp-icon" />
        <div>
          <h3>SEO Planning & Research</h3>
          <p>
            Defining your SEO goals, researching relevant keywords, and analyzing competitors to set a strong foundation.
          </p>
          <p>
            This stage involves identifying the right keywords, understanding user intent, and creating a roadmap for content and optimization efforts. A well-prepared SEO plan ensures all activities align with your business objectives.

        <div>
          <h3>On-Page & Off-Page Optimization</h3>
          <p>
            Improving website elements (like meta tags, headings, content) and building external signals (like backlinks) to strengthen search rankings.
          </p>
          <p>
            Effective SEO balances both on-page optimization — such as improving page speed, mobile-friendliness, and structured data — and off-page efforts like link building, guest blogging, and social sharing to boost your authority.

          <h3>Performance Monitoring</h3>
          <p>
            Tracking keyword rankings, traffic sources, and user behavior to measure results and adjust strategies.
          </p>
          <p>
            Using tools like Google Analytics, Search Console, and SEO software helps you identify what’s working, discover opportunities, and continuously refine your approach for better outcomes.
